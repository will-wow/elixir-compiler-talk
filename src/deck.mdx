# Elixir: What is it good for?

- High concurrency
- Low Processing
- Updates in the field
- High Uptime
- Developer Happiness

<Notes>

- Anyone in the Elixir community can rattle off the best use case for Elixir
- Anything a phone switch can do
- So long story short, I used Elixir for something completely different, and it went great!

# Compilers, what are they about?

| Feature              | Elixir | Compilers     |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Concurrency          | Yes    | Not this time |
| Processing           | Light  | Heavy         |
| Uptime               | High   | Crash         |
| Updates in the field | Yes    | No            |
| Developer Happiness  | Yes    | **Yes!**      |

<Notes>

- A compiler can make good use of concurrency, but mine doesn't
- Elixir isn't at its best when doing CPU-intensive processing, and that's all a compiler is
- Elixir is good at never crashing, and a compiler should crash as soon as it hits an error
- And Field updates aren't relevant to a local tool
- But the developer experience is still great, so I decided to do it anyway

# One more problem with my plan...

- So why did I write compiler?
